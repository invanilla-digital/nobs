No bullshit microframework

## Description

At the current state it's a work-in-progress side-project, 
that's supposed to become a usable PHP 8.1+ microframework unless I lose motivation for another couple years again
## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* PHP 8.1
* Common-sense
* No bullshit attitude


### Installing

Not yet, hopefully some day.

### Running tests

* `git clone`
* `composer install`
* `./vendor/bin/phpunit`
* ðŸ’¥ Boom ðŸ’¥

## Help

Did you manage to break something? Or did I manage to break something?
Feel free to create a new issue. I ~~might~~ definitely will have a look.
